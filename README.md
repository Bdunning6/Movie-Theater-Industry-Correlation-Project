## Introduction
Movie theaters have been a vital part of the motion picture industry for a long period of time, allowing film producers to generate profit while introducing their movies to the general public. But due to the introduction of streaming services such as Netflix and the ramifications of a worldwide pandemic, the abillity of movie theaters to generate profit has been diminished. But what leads a movie to be profitable? Does a higher budget mean it's more likely a film will profit? Do certain genre's and ratings of movies perform better than others? Or are the ratings of critics the most important? Through this project, I will analyze what makes a movie succesfull and develop a business statetgy that allows for theaters to adapt in order to remain profitable in the future. (Maybe some statistics about the rise of streaming services and closing theaters to make a more quantiative point?)
